This is a simple ray tracer written to help expand my knowledge of file parsing,
GUI's and as a side project that could keep me busy between more important
projects. As with the previous version of my ray tracer I have made it public so
that I may point at it and say "look at what I did, isn't it cool".

Currently this does not perform ray tracing. Currently it uses forward
projecto to do a wireframe rendering of the model. This works best with
the command line:

./model files/teapot/command file/teapot/model.obj

I plan to change the way this works so that no command file it provided.
The user simply provides a .obj file that it will render. I also plan to
change it so that when the user isn't moving the camera, it start doing
a full ray traced render of the model.

controls:
left click: mouse move causes the camera to rotate about object model
right click: mouse move causes the model to translate in the view area
middle click: vertical mouse movement zooms the camera in and out
