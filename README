This is a simple ray tracer written to help expand my knowledge of file parsing,
GUI's and as a side project that could keep me busy between more important
projects. As with the previous version of my ray tracer I have made it public so
that I may point at it and say "look at what I did, isn't it cool".

There is some funkyness to how this program has been designed to work. It will
read an obj file as the model no matter what. However, I plan to make it do its
rendering in two different ways.

1. if there is a command file provided, it will perform the commands and output
   the image in png format. This style of running the program was done to
   attempt to help some friends taking a graphics class. This allows me to use
   my ray tracer to render an image, show them what theirs should look like, and
   tell them where they are going wrong. In addition the other method of running
   the program will be able to produce a command file. This way of running the 
   program should be much faster as it will not load a gui. So a user could use
   the other method of running the program to produce a cool image, and then use
   this method for the ray tracing.

2. if there is no command file provided, it will load a gui and use perspective
   projection rendering to display the image. it will allow the user to move the
   camera around and save off the camera to a command file so that a ray traced
   image can be quickly rendered. If the user chooses they can run the ray
   tracer in the gui to see the rendering process.
